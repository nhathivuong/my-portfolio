For a seemingly simple design, a lot of thoughts have been put into the small details. I chose a cobalt blue because it has good visual contrast against black and white, allowing an increased accessibility without reling on extra tools. I also chose sans-serif since some studies shows that the legibility of this font type is better then a serif (times new roman) on screens. 

I also chose to have the navigation at the top of the screen. A common placement, which allows any user to easily find their desired information. After going through multiple start-up websites with fancy design, I came to the conclusion that a simple navigation bar allowed a seemless navigation through a high amount of information.

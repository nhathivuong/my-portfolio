When picking up new technologies, I use my existing knowledge to make connections and learn efficiently. For example, when learning Tailwind, I didn't rely on tutorials. Instead, I explored the official documentation and applied my CSS experience to understand it quickly. This approach reflects my problem-solving skills, adaptability, and ability to learn independentlyâ€”traits that help me stay up to date in web development.</p>

                <p className="text-justify font-fira p-4 w-[29vw] h-full drop-shadow-[1px_1px_1px_black] rounded-xl mt-2 mb-4">Having worked in an industry with frequent innovation, I learned to adapt quickly and shift priorities when unexpected tasks arose. This experience taught me how to manage additional workloads effectively. In school, I often took the initiative to help others. For instance, when the secretary of the student council couldn't attend a meeting, I stepped in to handle communications and took minutes, ensuring everything ran smoothly. This experience reflects my ability to collaborate, problem-solve, and remain flexible in dynamic environments.</p>
